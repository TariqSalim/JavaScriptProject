based on compound conditions as follows:
- No dependents and gross pay is greater than $1000.00, tax rate is 33%
- No dependents and gross pay is less than or equal to $1000.00 tax rate is 28%
- 1 to 3 dependents and gross pay is greater than $1000.000, tax rate is 25%
- 1 to 3 dependents and gross pay is less than or equal to $1000.00 : tax rate is 22%.
- 4 to 6 dependents and gross pay is greater than $1000.00, tax rate is 22%;
- 4 to 6 dependents and gross pay is less than or equal to $1000.00: tax rate is 15%.
- More than 6 dependents and gross pay is greater than $1000.00, tax rate is 15%.
- More than 6 dependents and gross pay is less than or equal to $1000.00, tax rate is 10%.
Be sure to include an appropriate title to the page.
