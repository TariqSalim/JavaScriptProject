<!-- Create a web page that calculates an employee's net pay. The program should prompt for an employee's hourly pay rate, number of hours worked per week and number of dependents claimed.
If the employee works more than 40 hours in a week, overtime is calculated at 1.5 times the regular hourly rate. Taxes are then deducted from the gross pay as follows :
- No dependents : tax rate is 28%
- 1 to 3 dependents : tax rate is 25%
- 4 to 6 dependents : tax rate is 15%
- More than 6 dependents : tax rate is 10%
